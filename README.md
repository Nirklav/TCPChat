# Description:
Multi-user chat with mixed architecture: client-server, p2p. 
Server works tightly with certificates. Server and users should have certificates. But program can generate self signed certificates that supports too, but with some peculiarities.

First of all if server has self-signed certificate then users those connect to him will be warned.
Users also can use self-signed certificates, if them have it, then them will be marked with the appropriate icons in users list.
Also user can save certificates to local trusted TCPChat storage.

Here is this user icons:

  1. ![alt tag](https://raw.github.com/Nirklav/TCPChat/master/UI/Images/checked.png) This is approved certificate. This certificate is valid or it was saved in local TCPChat trusted certificates storage. Also user nick match to certificate common name.
  2. ![alt tag](https://raw.github.com/Nirklav/TCPChat/master/UI/Images/checkedNotMatch.png) This is also approved certificate, but nick does't match to certificate common name.
  3. ![alt tag](https://raw.github.com/Nirklav/TCPChat/master/UI/Images/notChecked.png) This is not approved self-signed certificate.
